            <p> Ever since my dad introduced me to computers at a young age, I had an interest in techology. I am about 6 or 7 years old in this picture which is not even the age I started to use computers!<br></br>
                My dad and I would play games such as Command & Conquer or Warcraft against each other via LAN with a cable that ran from my bedroom through our living room to my dads computer.<br></br>
